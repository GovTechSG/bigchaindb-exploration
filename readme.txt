# Bigchaindb

## Quick start on bigchaindb with docker

https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/server/en/latest/appendices/run-with-docker.html

### Notes:

To connect to your rethinkdb node: http://0.0.0.0:58080
To connect to your bigchaindb node: http://0.0.0.0:59984

Postman collection to create, transfer and query transaction is included in resource folder


## Pros
1) Good for assets transfer
2) Good for basic constraint based transfer. eg: If 2 or more owners of an asset agree then transfer the asset to another person.

Cons

1) Smart contract concept is not matured
2) Not byzantine fault tolerance
